        <h2>Why lavender?</h2>
        <p>Lavender is an herb native to northern Africa and the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. Lavender has been used since ancient times for its medicinal and healing effects, unique fragrance, and to enhance the flavour of food.
          The herb is highly regarded for skin and beauty and is commonly used in fragrances and shampoos to help wash and purify the skin. In fact, the word lavender originally stems from the Latin word lavare which means “to wash”.</p>
